## Overview 🌟

### The Challenge 🧪

Users should be able to:

- ❌ View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- ❌ Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- ✅ View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- ✅ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- ❌ **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

I hope to add js functionality in the future, but for now, here's the plain html css page.

## My process 🏗️

### Built with 🛠️

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript(_In the future_)

**I use my own custom svg for the button, since the one provided does not work 😢

### What I learned 🧠

Absolutely nothing! _yet..._

Indeed, when I finally implement some functionality using js, i will try to post here everything I learned from such experience, but for now, enjoy a _blank page_

### Continued development 🚀

As mentioned previously, I plan to implement _actual_ functionality in this site, but for now, it's completely static.
